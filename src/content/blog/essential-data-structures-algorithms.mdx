``European date format``
`Apologies` for forcing my American ways to you European users. I've added a setting to change the date formats to European (dd/mm/yyyy).
However, most dates on the graphs seem to default to American format regardless. I am aware of this, and currently working on this.

Changes to the Information sections
There was a small confusion from the patch 0.5.0 regarding the This Month/This Year vs Published This Month/Published This Year. We now have Total (Views/Likes/Comments) This Month/Year which is time-accurate metric measured from our data (instead of the episode data).
Similarly, Average information boxes are also updated to be based on the data collected over time instead of per episode.

Lastly, we have removed the following features: Average Episode Length box & First-Time Commenters graph. They are not completely gone but are removed for the time being.
