## Major Changes to the Dashboard

For a while, I've been working on implementing React framework into the extension. 
The first step was overhauling the popup, which was implemented in the last patch.
Without any big issue from the change, I've taken the next step of "react"-ifying the dashboard.

On top of that, Nen and I have had various discussions on switching from Plotly to Chart JS for generating the graphs.
One of the main issue in Plotly was the lack of support for customization (e.g. mouse cursor type, date & number formatting).
Also I think Chart JS graphs look a lot more aesthetic âœ¨

So now, I'm super excited to release the newly revamped dashboard with various new features and improvements!

### What's new in v.0.6.0

- **Sortable** Episode List & Commenter Countries List
- Per Episode graph now opens **dialog** with more detailed information when its data point is clicked
- Top words graph now supports **local filter** (instead of hardcoded filter in the backend)
- **Subs Tab** for subscribers related information & graphs
- **Date range filter** for time-series graphs (e.g. Daily graphs & Total graphs)
- **Daily graphs** for each stats (e.g. views)
- Click on the Indicator graph to **switch** between value and percentage change 
- Data information boxes (e.g. Total Views box, Average Views box) now feature **date range options**
