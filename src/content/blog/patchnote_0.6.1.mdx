## Clean-Ups & Bug Fixes

Last patch involved a lot of new changes to the dashboard, both in the visual aspect and the logic aspect.
And thanks to a lot of feedbacks from the beta users and recent influx of new users, many bugs & glitches were spotted.

In this patch, I've fixed a lot of bugs (found more bugs while fixing too), and cleaned up some ugly parts while going through the code.

### What's Changed in v.0.6.1

#### Dashboard
- The **data labels** (in **Information** & **Episodes Graph** sections) are fixed
- The **disappearing dashboard glitch** is fixed
- **Error handling** logic is modified to handle errors correctly

#### Popup
- The **number & date format setting** is now separated into two different settings
- The **perpetual loading screen on Webtoons List** when logged out of Webtoons is fixed
- The **popup tutorial** can now be skipped
- Popup now has our social links and Ko-Fi link for support
