## Updates & Bug Fix

It's been a while since the last patch, and I'm sorry for the delay in updates.
The month of May was brutal for us as all of us started getting sick one after another.
But we are all better now and back to the grind ðŸ’ª

Couple months ago, Webtoons changed their Comments API. This was a major setback for us (as well as other extensions such as Comment Wizard).
It took us some time, but Rolo readjusted the wrapper around the new API. But with the new change, we realize that few data points were no longer available.
One of the major change was the removal of the commenter's location data, which we used to create a cholopleth map of commenters.
This update sadly has removed the map from the dashboard since it is no longer updated.

To compensate for this, however, I've implemented a new component to list commenters by their comment count throughout the series!
It may not be as cool or useful as the cholopleth map, but I hope that this list would allow you to see who is your biggest fan.
