## Hotfix

There was a report that pointed me to a loading issue for data validation that was implemented on last patch.
Main cause of the issue was the lack of check for the data loading state for the api endpoints that the data validation was checking.

Additionally, the last patch removed few css files as a part of the code clean-up.
However, one of the removed file was still in use for the bug report form.
The file is added back, and some additional compiling issues have been addressed as well.

### What's Changed in v.0.6.2

#### Dashboard
- The incorrect data validation is fixed

#### Popup
- The bug report form is fixed
- The web site link url is fixed
